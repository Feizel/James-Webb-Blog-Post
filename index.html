        <h1>James-Webb Space Telescope Overview.</h1>
        <h2>The focus on space programs & exploration is exploding globally</h2>
        <h6 class="byline">Article Written By: <a href="https://www.linkedin/in/feizel-ze-maduna">Feizel Maduna</a></h6>
        <p><span class="first_letter">T</span>he dawn of a new era in astronomy has begun with the launch of NASA's
            newest piece of equipment - The <i>James Webb Space Telescope</i> - back on 25 December 2021 at 2:20pm SAST aboard the European Space Agency's Ariane 5 rocket. It was named for James Webb, NASA's lead
            administrator
            during the 1950s and 60s. After the telescope name was chosen, scientists & astronomers worldwide
            immediately sought to use this engineering-wonder of an instrument. The Webb telescope will be the
            premier
            observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide. It will study every phase in
            the
            history of our Universe, ranging from the first luminous glows after the Big Bang, to the formation of
            solar
            systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth, to the evolution of our own Solar System.
        </p>
        <p>Several innovative technologies have been developed for Webb. These include a primary mirror made of 18
            separate segments that unfold and adjust to shape after launch. The mirrors are made of
            ultra-lightweight
            beryllium. Webb's biggest feature is a tennis court sized five-layer sunshield that attenuates heat from
            the
            Sun more than a million times. The telescopes four instruments - cameras and spectrometers - have
            detectors
            that are able to record extremely faint signals. One instrument (NIRSpec) has programmable
            microshutters,
            which enable observation up to 100 objects simultaneously. Webb also has a cryocooler for cooling the
            mid-infrared detectors of another instrument (MIRI) to a very cold 7 kelvins (minus 447 Fahrenheit) so
            they
            can work.

        <h3>Science</h3>
        <p>The James Webb Space Telescope will be a giant leap forward in our quest to understand the Universe and
            our origins. JWST will examine every phase of cosmic history: from the first luminous glows after the
            Big Bang to the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets to the evolution of our own solar system. The
            science goals for the Webb can be grouped into four themes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The End of the Dark Ages: First Light and Reionization - JWST will be a powerful time machine with
                infrared vision that will peer back over 13.5 billion years to see the first stars and galaxies
                forming out of the darkness of the early universe.
            </li>
            <li>Assembly of Galaxies - JWST's unprecedented infrared sensitivity will help astronomers to compare
                the faintest, earliest galaxies to today's grand spirals and ellipticals, helping us to understand
                how galaxies assemble over billions of years.
            </li>
            <li>The Birth of Stars and Protoplanetary Systems - JWST will be able to see right through and into
                massive clouds of dust that are opaque to visible-light observatories like Hubble, where stars and
                planetary systems are being born.
            </li>
            <li>Planetary Systems and the Origins of Life - JWST will tell us more about the atmospheres of
                extrasolar planets, and perhaps even find the building blocks of life elsewhere in the universe. In
                addition to other planetary systems, JWST will also study objects within our own Solar System.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Observatory</h3>
        <p>The Observatory of the James Webb Space Telescope is comprised of three elements: the Integrated Science
            Instrument Module (ISIM), the Optical Telescope Element (OTE), which includes the mirrors and backplane,
            and the Spacecraft Element, which includes the Spacecraft Bus and Sunshield.
        </p>
        <p>The Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) includes Webb's science instruments. The OTE is the eye
            of the Observatory and it gathers the light coming from space and provides it to the science instruments
            located in the ISIM. The backplane is like the Webb's "spine". It supports the mirrors.
        </p>
        <p>The sunshield subsystem separates the observatory into a warm sun-facing side (spacecraft bus) and a cold
            anti-sun side (OTE and ISIM). The sunshield keeps the heat of the Sun, Earth, and spacecraft bus
            electronics away from the OTE and ISIM so that these pieces of the Observatory can be kept very cold
            (The operating temperature has to be kept under 50 kelvins or -370 deg F).
        </p>
        <p>The Spacecraft Bus provides the support functions for the operation of the Observatory. The bus houses
            the six major subsystems needed to operate the spacecraft: the Electrical Power Subsystem, the Attitude
            Control Subsystem, the Communication Subsystem, the Command and Data Handling Subsystem, the Propulsion
            Subsystem, and the Thermal Control Subsystem.
        </p>
        <p>The momentum flap balances the solar pressure on the sunshield, like a trim flap in sailing. It's not
            adjustable on orbit, but it is while it's on the ground.
        </p>
